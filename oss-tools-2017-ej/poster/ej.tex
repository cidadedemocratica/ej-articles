\begin{block}{Facing the bubbles}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Social media recommendation algorithms are black boxes
    
    \item Engines and systems are specialized in analyzing our profiles. We only receive
    content about what we like, what we follow and what our friends see.

    \item People are stuck in a phenomenon that we call ``bubbles of opinion``

    \item The bubbles caused by this algorithms unbalance the dialog and minorities
    are despised.
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Polis}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Polis is a web based platform for online debates that uses A.I. to
    show the different opinion groups in a discussion.

    \item Allow people to create online conversations to debate about any subject,
    anonymous and uses a different approach to build the dialog between users.

    \item Using a concept that we call ``crowdsource participation``, people can
    give their opinion by simple clicking in ``agree``, ``disagree`` or ``skip``
    in other's comments. Participation gets easier in a one click effort.

    \item The system applies clustering algorithms to identify the different groups
    of opinion based on the reactions of the participants in the comments.

    \item Identify majority and minority consensus in the global scope and in
    each group scope.
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{What is Empujando Juntos}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item A Free Open Source Software for social participation that aims to
    increase communication between majority and minority, blowing bubbles of
    opinion.

    \item An platform built on top of Polis that offers new features
    with gamification concepts.
    
    \item A tool that allows activists and non extremist people to engage regular
    people in online discussions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Why Empurrando Juntos?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item E.J. goes beyond Polis and offers more interaction to users in a online
    discussion.

    \item Brings new resources using gamification concepts based on the profiles
    of the participants as a mean to bring diversity to online discussions.

    \item 100\% FOSS.
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}


\begin{block}{Empujando Juntos Features}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Uses Polis engine to obtain the groups of opinion.

    \item Mobile responsive and minimalist design on top of Polis embed iframe.

    \item Provides a resource that we called ``the Push``. People in ownership of
    this ability (gamification) are able to send direct messages and create events in the platform.

    \item The ``Push`` is given to special actors in the groups formed by Polis.
    Three profiles are considered, the activist, the bridge and the consultation
    owner.

        \label{fig:background:free-software-repository}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    \item Monitoring Polis conversations created through the App
    to identify activists and bridge participants to give them the ``Push``
    power.

    \item Activists can open events and notify people in his group cluster.

    \item Comments created by bridge people are spread to others by direct
    notifications.

    \item Consultation creators have their content highlighted and can also open
    events in the platform, like activists

\begin{block}{System Architecture}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Front-end application, written in React Native
    and a NodeJS server.

    \item The server module is responsible for managing users, ``the Push'', and
    to make the interface with Polis API
  \end{itemize}

  \end{figure}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Integration with Polis}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Based on an external user capability on Polis API (xID), Pushing Together
  will create users and debates locally and just use polis clusters through xID
  \item At the first moment, the webview of Polis consultations like group
  exhibition and comments carousel will be used by Pushing Together UI
  \item Some profiles can be calculated using Polis API (like the percentage of a
  group a person is to know where the bridges are) but some could be made locally

  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Final Remarks}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pushing Together arise as a potential tool to bridge dialog between society and
    the state, making different analyzes about the opinion of the distinct groups
    and also opening new possibilities for the expression of these opinions with ``the
    Push`` resource. Besides, the project was born with transparency and collaboration
    principles, building a base for a prospective evolution.

    \item We are now working on a research to evolve the clustering service that
    will fit our application model. Parallelly, our next steps include evolving the
    mobile application using mocked data and validating the user interface.

    \item All our contributions are published in open repositories available at:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \url{github.com/cidadedemocratica/pushingtogether}
        \item \url{github.com/cidadedemocratica/app_pushingtogether}
