\begin{block}{What is Empujando Juntos}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Allow people to create online conversations to debate about any subject
    with a different paradigm that we call ``crowdsource``, which fosters
    more engagement than standard models like forum/thread

    \item People can to give their opinion by simple clicking in ``agree``,
    ``disagree`` or ``skip`` in other's comments

    \item Identify different groups of opinion based on the reactions of the
    participants in the comments using clustering algorithms.

    \item Uses Polis engine to calculate the groups. Every opinion is considered,
    majority and minority.

    \item Applying gamification concepts we invented the ``Push`` power. People in
    ownership of this ability are able to send direct messages and create events
    in the platform

    \item The ``Push`` is given to special actors in the groups formed by Polis.
    Three profiles are considered, the activist, the bridge and the consultation
    owner.

\begin{block}{Why Empurrando Juntos?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We use the successful concept of conversation brought by Polis and extend it,
    allowing users to have an even more interaction with each other.

    \item  The ``Push`` power aims to foster the discussion between different
    groups of opinion, and increase the engagement of people in terms of social
    participation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Empujando Juntos Features}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Mobile responsive and minimalist design on top of Polis embed iframe

    \item Hourly monitoring for Polis conversations created through the App
    to identify activists and bridge participants and give them the ``Push``
    resource

    \item Activists can open events and notify people in his group cluster

    \item Comments created by bridge people are spread to others through notifications

    \item Consultation owners have their content highlighted and they can open
    events that are notified to all other users
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{System Architecture}
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Front-end application, written in React Native\footnote{\url{facebook.github.io/react-native}}
    and a NodeJS\footnote{\url{nodejs.org/en}} server.

    \item The server module is responsible for managing users, ``the Push'', and
    to make the interface with Polis, which holds the conversation data and
    the clustering engine for finding groups of opinion
  \end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Final Remarks}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pushing Together arise as a potential tool to bridge dialog between society and
    the state, making different analyzes about the opinion of the distinct groups
    and also opening new possibilities for the expression of these opinions with ``the
    Push`` resource. Besides, the project was born with transparency and collaboration
    principles, building a base for a prospective evolution.

    \item We are now working on a research to evolve the clustering service that
    will fit our application model. Parallelly, our next steps include evolving the
    mobile application using mocked data and validating the user interface.

    \item All our contributions are published in open repositories available at \url{github.com/
    cidadedemocratica/pushingtogether} and \url{github.com/cidadedemocratica/
    app_pushingtogether}.
